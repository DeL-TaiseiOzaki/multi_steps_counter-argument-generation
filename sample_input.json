    "topic": "Should goal-line technology be implemented in professional football matches?",
    "context": "The implementation of goal-line technology in professional football is an inevitable progression in the sport's evolution. Despite FIFA's reluctance, there is no explicit policy against using technological assistance. FIFA's disciplinary code allows referees to make final decisions during matches, and they already rely on input from assistant referees for incidents they haven't personally witnessed. The introduction of earpieces in 2006 connecting referees, assistant referees, and the fourth official demonstrates that technology has already been successfully integrated into football. Goal-line technology is simply the next logical step in this technological advancement. Football must adapt to the 21st century, and the current resistance to goal-line technology is outdated. Embracing this technology aligns with existing practices and will further enhance the accuracy and fairness of the game."

    "topic": "should homework be abolished?",
    "context":"The argument for abolishing homework can be summarized as follows:Firstly, homework takes away children's free time, causing stress and fatigue. Children need time outside of school to relax, play, and engage in activities that promote their overall development.\nhomework can exacerbate educational inequalities based on family backgrounds. Children without sufficient parental support or conducive home environments may struggle to complete homework effectively, creating an unfair disadvantage.\n\nThirdly, the effectiveness of homework in enhancing academic performance is not always clear. Instead, improving classroom instruction and making lessons more engaging can better ensure that students grasp the material\n\nFinally, abolishing homework allows teachers to focus more on lesson preparation and student interactions, potentially improving the quality of education. Teachers can use this time to develop more innovative and effective teaching methods.\n\nFor these reasons, abolishing homework can contribute to the overall well-being of students and the improvement of educational quality."
