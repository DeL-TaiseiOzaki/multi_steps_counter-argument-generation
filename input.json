    "affirmative-argument":"The argument for abolishing homework can be summarized as follows:Firstly, homework takes away children's free time, causing stress and fatigue. Children need time outside of school to relax, play, and engage in activities that promote their overall development.\nhomework can exacerbate educational inequalities based on family backgrounds. Children without sufficient parental support or conducive home environments may struggle to complete homework effectively, creating an unfair disadvantage.\n\nThirdly, the effectiveness of homework in enhancing academic performance is not always clear. Instead, improving classroom instruction and making lessons more engaging can better ensure that students grasp the material\n\nFinally, abolishing homework allows teachers to focus more on lesson preparation and student interactions, potentially improving the quality of education. Teachers can use this time to develop more innovative and effective teaching methods.\n\nFor these reasons, abolishing homework can contribute to the overall well-being of students and the improvement of educational quality."
