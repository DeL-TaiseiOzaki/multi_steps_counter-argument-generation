    "context": "Performing surgery on infants without medical necessity is inherently risky and irresponsible. The Royal Dutch Medical Association has stated that no medical organization worldwide can definitively prove a medical need for infant circumcision. They emphasize that due to the lack of medical necessity and the genuine risk of complications, extremely stringent requirements should be in place for providing information and advice on this procedure. Despite this, circumcision is routinely performed globally, often by individuals with minimal medical training, and is frequently accepted by parents based on religious beliefs rather than medical evidence. This practice exposes infants to unnecessary surgical risks without clear medical benefits, which can be considered a form of child abuse.",

Despite FIFA's reluctance, there is no explicit policy against using technological assistance. FIFA's disciplinary code allows referees to make final decisions during matches, and they already rely on input from assistant referees for incidents they haven't personally witnessed. The introduction of earpieces in 2006 connecting referees, assistant referees, and the fourth official demonstrates that technology has already been successfully integrated into football. Goal-line technology is simply the next logical step in this technological advancement. Football must adapt to the 21st century, and the current resistance to goal-line technology is outdated.

    "topic": "Should copyright protection periods be significantly shortened?",
    "context": "Lengthy copyright protection periods are highly inefficient for the distribution of creative works. While a small number of artists achieve great financial success, most only earn modest profits from their creations. The majority of income from copyrighted works is generated shortly after publication. Ultimately, extended copyright protection restricts the use of works while providing little ongoing benefit to the original creators. Shortening copyright periods would greatly benefit consumers, allowing them to freely access, share, and reinterpret these works sooner. Artists who prioritize having their work seen and appreciated should recognize that reduced copyright duration serves this goal better. Long copyright terms primarily benefit corporations that acquire large portfolios of works and exploit them long after the artists' deaths. Evidence shows that when the United States required copyright renewal after 28 years, only 15% of copyrights were actually renewed. This suggests that most works no longer generate significant value for their creators after a relatively short period. Shortening copyright protection would lead to increased appreciation and dissemination of creative works, benefiting both artists and society as a whole.",

    "context": "Legal coca cultivation would drive economic growth in developing nations. Millions in South America traditionally chew coca leaves, making it an essential income source in impoverished Andean regions. Attempts to eradicate coca farming have harmed poor farmers and caused social unrest. However, when allowed, coca cultivation can yield economic benefits. Andean farmers believe coca chewing increases productivity in agriculture, fisheries, and mining. Legalizing coca cultivation globally would expand these economic advantages and unlock the plant's full potential. Coca leaves have various applications beyond traditional use, including as stimulants and flavoring agents in beverages, and in products like syrups, teas, shampoos, and toothpaste. They may also have potential as general anesthetics. Only through global legalization can we fully explore and benefit from coca's diverse uses, moving beyond the stigma associated with its illegal cocaine production. This approach would allow humanity to harness the plant's full economic and product potential, rather than being limited by fears surrounding its illicit use.",

Currently, students from privileged backgrounds have significant advantages in accessing higher education. For example, in the UK, top universities like Oxford and Cambridge admit over 50% of their students from private schools, despite only 7% of UK students attending such institutions. Similar disparities exist for ethnic minorities in both the UK and USA, where white students are more likely to graduate high school and attend college compared to black and Hispanic students. These disparities reflect the advantages given to wealthier children from certain socioeconomic and racial groups, who benefit from superior education and more stable home environments. It is unjust that these arbitrary factors, unrelated to talent or hard work, play such a crucial role in determining one's life prospects. Furthermore, this situation undermines true meritocracy by allowing wealth, rather than ability, to be the primary determinant of success. Affirmative action policies are therefore essential to level the playing field and create a more equitable system of university admissions.",

Chewing coca leaves produces only mild effects, unlike cocaine use. In fact, a 1995 World Health Organisation study found no negative health impacts from coca leaf use and noted its positive therapeutic, sacred, and social functions for indigenous Andean populations. Coca leaves may even help combat obesity, and there's no evidence of addiction to coca leaf chewing. At most, its effects are comparable to caffeine.

The study found that among 6th and 7th graders who received abstinence-only education, only about one-third became sexually active over the following two years. In contrast, nearly half of the students who attended other types of classes became sexually active during the same period. Importantly, the study also revealed that abstinence-only education did not negatively impact condom usage, a finding consistent with the Mathematica Policy Research study cited by opponents of this approach.

When consumers buy local, they help farmers receive a fair price for their produce, as opposed to selling through middlemen or large corporations where farmers often receive only a small fraction of the final retail price. In the USA, farmers may get as little as 18 cents of every dollar spent in stores. By selling directly to consumers through farmers' markets and farm shops, producers can secure better income, which is crucial for small-scale farmers and those practicing sustainable farming methods like organic production. This approach helps maintain local agricultural livelihoods and prevents farmers from being forced off their land due to financial pressures. Even when retailers buy locally, it still supports the local farming community, regardless of whether the retailer itself is locally owned. Prioritizing local food purchases thus plays a vital role in sustaining local economies and preserving diverse farming practices.",

    "topic": "Should NATO continue to expand its membership to include new countries?",
    "context": "NATO plays a crucial role in maintaining peace and prosperity in Europe as part of the broader international framework. While no single organization can ensure peace on its own, NATO's expansion is as essential as that of other institutions like the OSCE or EU in promoting stability across the continent. NATO's commitment to building a new peaceful order based on freedom, justice, and democracy, as expressed in its Message from Turnberry, underscores its importance in the post-Cold War era. The organization's unique ability to provide collective defense and foster security cooperation builds trust among member states, which is vital for lasting peace. NATO's Secretary General emphasized that enlargement is necessary to avoid perpetuating a dangerous division between a secure West and an uncertain East. By expanding its membership, NATO helps bridge this gap and demonstrates that the Cold War divisions in Europe have truly ended. Thus, NATO's continued expansion is crucial for healing historical fault lines and promoting a unified, secure Europe.",

    "context": "Underground Nuclear Storage is Necessary\n\nAll nations, even those without nuclear power programs, generate radioactive waste. This is because nuclear materials and technology are used in various fields such as research and medicine. For instance, medical imaging equipment relies on radioactive elements. As a result, every country produces some level of nuclear waste that requires proper disposal. Therefore, adopting underground storage for nuclear waste is a necessity for all nations to safely manage their radioactive materials.",

This vast timescale directly contradicts the Creationist belief in a young Earth, which typically claims the planet is only a few thousand years old. The overwhelming evidence for an ancient Earth strongly supports the theory of evolution and undermines the Creationist worldview.",

    "context": "Open primaries enable voters to make more nuanced and considered choices in elections. By allowing all voters to participate, regardless of party affiliation, open primaries encourage the electorate to evaluate candidates based on a broader range of factors beyond just party loyalty. This system allows voters to weigh various considerations, such as a candidate's individual merits, policy positions, and qualifications, alongside their party affiliation. As a result, open primaries provide a more comprehensive and flexible approach to candidate selection, reflecting the diverse preferences and priorities of the electorate.",

    "context": "Marriage demands an unreasonable commitment in modern society. In the UK, people typically marry around age 30, yet life expectancy is about 80 years. This means individuals are expected to maintain a specific lifestyle for a period longer than they've been alive. The increasing social acceptance of having multiple life partners throughout one's lifetime further supports the notion that marriage is either an unrealistic expectation or a meaningless formality not truly intended to last. These factors suggest that the traditional concept of marriage may no longer align with contemporary lifestyles and expectations, calling into question its relevance in modern society.",

    "topic": "Is feminism still necessary in today's society?",
    "context": "Feminism remains necessary and relevant in today's society. There are numerous issues that still need to be addressed. In the UK, domestic violence affects one in four women, and while rape reporting has increased over the past three decades, conviction rates have significantly decreased. Some European countries, like Ireland and Malta, still restrict abortion rights for women, highlighting the ongoing struggle for equality. Globally, the importance of feminism is even more pronounced. In the United States, women continue to face wage disparities, earning only 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, with the gap widening for women of color. African-American women earn 68% of what men earn, while Latina women earn just 58%. These persistent inequalities demonstrate that feminism still has many goals to achieve, and feminists should continue to campaign for these important causes.",

    "topic": "Should the media have the right to scrutinize the private lives of public figures?",
    "context": "The distinction between public and private matters for public figures is inherently blurry and difficult to define. Attempting to establish strict rules would be arbitrary and could potentially shield corrupt or dishonest behavior from public scrutiny. For instance, French President Mitterrand concealed his cancer diagnosis from voters for years and secretly brought his mistress and illegitimate daughter on official state visits at public expense. These examples highlight the challenge of categorizing such actions as purely private or public matters. Implementing rigid boundaries between public and private spheres would severely hamper the media's ability to fulfill its watchdog role. In a scenario with strict privacy rules, events of public interest occurring in the private lives of public figures could remain unreported, leaving the media unable to inform the public about potentially important issues.",

    "context": "In today's fast-paced media environment, journalistic standards are declining, and giving individuals the right to respond to unfair portrayals can help improve accuracy. As news production speeds up and journalists face increasing pressure, mistakes become more common. Currently, media outlets may only exercise caution when there's a risk of legal action, setting an unreasonably high bar for accuracy. Even seemingly minor negative mentions in local papers, while unlikely to attract national attention or legal consequences, can significantly damage a private citizen's reputation within their community. Allowing individuals to respond to such reports would encourage media outlets to be more careful with their facts and provide a means of recourse for those who feel unfairly portrayed, without the need for costly legal action.",

    "context": "Even seemingly innocent websites can have severe negative impacts on society. Some governments, like Vietnam, have already banned social networking sites such as Facebook due to their potential for harm. In the UK, social media platforms were used to coordinate widespread riots across multiple cities, causing extensive property damage, violence, and even deaths. These events demonstrate that ordinary citizens can use apparently harmless Internet sites to organize destructive activities that harm thousands. To protect the population and maintain order, it is crucial for governments to have the ability to censor websites that can be used as tools for coordinating such disruptive behavior, especially during times of unrest. This censorship power is necessary to safeguard society from the potential misuse of online platforms.",

    "context": "The superdelegate system violates the fundamental democratic principle of \"one person, one vote.\" It's undemocratic for one vote to carry thousands of times more weight than another. While superdelegates were introduced as a compromise to earlier attempts by party insiders to control candidate selection, the effect is the same: it restricts the rights of party members and activists to choose their preferred candidates. This system undermines the basic democratic process within the party and should be eliminated to ensure fair representation and equal voting power for all party members.",

Genetic screening of fetuses can help identify severe hereditary diseases that cause immense suffering, such as Tay-Sachs syndrome. This condition results in the accumulation of fatty substances in nerve cells due to recurring infections. Even with the best medical care, children with Tay-Sachs typically do not survive beyond the age of four. By allowing parents to screen for such devastating conditions, we can potentially prevent unnecessary suffering and early death, aligning with the duty of liberal societies to protect their members from avoidable harm.",

The notion that these two groups can coexist peacefully within a single state is unrealistic given their long history of conflict spanning nearly a century. While future generations may eventually find a way to live together harmoniously, it is impractical to base current policy decisions on such an idealistic vision. The deep-seated tensions and animosity between the two peoples make it impossible to implement a one-state solution that adheres to democratic principles of inclusion and tolerance in the foreseeable future. Therefore, separating the two nations into distinct states remains the most viable path to peace and stability in the region.",

The Moon offers significant advantages as a base for investigating extraterrestrial life and venturing deeper into the cosmos. Its lower gravity, lack of atmosphere, and position in space make it a more suitable launching point for missions to other planets and celestial bodies compared to Earth. By prioritizing lunar colonization, we create a springboard for humanity's expansion into the universe, enabling more efficient and far-reaching space exploration efforts.",

    "context": "Incentivizing Western companies to develop anonymity software for activists in authoritarian regimes is the most effective approach. Western nations, being technologically advanced and leaders in internet development, are best positioned to create and distribute this technology. Their software would be significantly more difficult for target regimes to hack or subvert compared to products from other regions. Furthermore, the West possesses specialized industry clusters, like Silicon Valley, which are crucial for efficient software production and distribution. These companies have unparalleled expertise in developing and disseminating high-quality products globally. Government subsidies are necessary because uprising participants typically lack financial resources, limiting market demand for such software. By providing incentives, Western governments can stimulate the creation of top-quality products that will both save lives and increase the likelihood of successful uprisings. This approach leverages Western technological superiority and existing infrastructure to produce effective, affordable software that meets the critical needs of activists in authoritarian regimes.",
